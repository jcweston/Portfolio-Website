                        I have worked for 10 years as a Chemist/Laboratory Technician in the chemical industry, before making the decision in 2019 to change careers and train to become a Web Developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This decision has allowed me to focus on my creativity and problem-solving skills, while still retaining the analytical and detail-oriented mindset of my chemistry background.

                    <p>
                        I am currently working on several Web Design projects (including this Portfolio) to expand and showcase my skills.
